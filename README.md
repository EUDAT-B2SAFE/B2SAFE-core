B2SAFE service code for EUDAT project.

It is released under BSD license.

The EUDAT (http://www.eudat.eu) B2SAFE Service offers functionality to replicate datasets across different data centres in a safe and efficient way while maintaining all information required to easily find and query information about the replica locations. The information about the replica locations and other important information is stored in PID (Persistent IDentifier) records, each managed in separate administrative domains. The B2SAFE Service is implemented as an iRODS (http://www.irods.org) module providing a set of iRODS rules or policies to interface with the EPIC (http://www.pidconsortium.eu) handle API and uses the iRODS middleware to replicate datasets from a source data (or community) centre to a destination data centre.
