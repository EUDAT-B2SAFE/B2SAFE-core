B2SAFE package 3.1.2 [2016/10/25]
It includes:
- Few new rules implementing minor functions to rerieve PID record key-value
pair and to convert boolean values.
- An experimental new feature, which is a proof of concept, so not ready for
production: the metadata ingestion scripts. It is a set of python script to generate a METS
manifest file for a collection, parse it and populate a neo4j graphDB.

B2SAFE package 3.2-beta [2016/08/24]
It includes two main new features:
1) the monitoring probe for iRODS: a bash script compatible with nagios-like tools to actively monitor the iRODS server
2) the metadata ingestion scripts: a set of python script to generate a METS manifest file for a collection, parse it and populate a neo4j graphDB.

B2SAFE package 3.1.1 [2016/04/22]
- added support for HSv8
- initial implementation of the role based approach for the authorization mechanism

B2SAFE package 3.1.0-beta [2016/02/09]
new version of the authentication scripts

B2SAFE package 3.0.2 [2015/11/27]

fixed support for debian package bulding

B2SAFE package 3.0.0 [2015/10/23]

It is still backward compatible with iRODS 3.3.1 .
- added more flexibility in data replication: it is now possible to replicate
data and register them asynchronously.
- improved the response messages of the main replication, registration and data
integrity chek rules
- removed the need of a shared collection
- added a couple of features as a preview: asynchronous messaging and system
metadata handling.
- consolidated the deployment procedure.

B2SAFE package 3.0 [2014/12/18]
This is the first version compatible with iRODS v4.0.x .
It is still backward compatible with iRODS 3.3.1 .
- added two further dependencies: defusedxml, lxml .
- improved documentation
- added new rules: EUDATgetLastAVU, EUDATModifyAVU, EUDATcountMetaKeys
  EUDATrp_checkMeta, EUDATrp_ingestObject, EUDATrp_transferInitiated, EUDATrp_transferFinished

B2SAFE module 2.3 [2014/10/30]
Unless you need to apply the patches mentioned in the documentation, there
is no need to recompile the module.
- completed the implementation of the integrity check tools
- extended the authentication mechanism to import automatically X.509 certificate DN
- improved the EPIC client, adding more command line options, optimizing the code
  and improving security against XML vulnerabilities.
- added new rules: EUDATiCHECKSUMdate, EUDATeURLsearch, EUDATIntegrityCheck, EUDATVerifyCollection
- added a script named quota_stats.py to calculate the storage stats (used space, number of objects)
  per collection
- added new document "tutorial" in the docs directory

B2SAFE module 2.2.1 [2014/08/22]
This is mainly a bug fix release with minor updates related to deployment, 
test and integrity check scripts. 
Unless you need to apply the patches mentioned in the documentation, there
is no need to recompile the module.
- fixed URI retrieval in the epic client function modifyHandle
- fixed the PPID update in function EUDATCreatePID
- updated docs/integrityCheck.pdf and docs/administrator.guide.pdf.
- fixed a function name mismatch related to the rule EUDATUpdateLogging in catchError.re
- added a test module for all scripts in cmd
- update fix regarding to function EUDATeCHECKSUMupdate
- update of the shell based install script
- added script for verification of checksums on TSM

B2SAFE module 2.2 [2014/07/09]
- defined a set of properties to publish the basic local B2SAFE configuration
- on demand checksum generation and verification tools based on replica location paths
- partial implementation of a basic authentication mechanism: sync of remote user accounts with local cache

B2SAFE module 2.1 [2014/06/04]
- refined the integrity check mechanism
- defined a rule for the replication of a collection of objects
- added a script to deploy automatically the module
- bug fixing
