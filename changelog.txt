It includes:
- Few new rules implementing minor functions to rerieve PID record key-value
pair and to convert boolean values.
- An experimental new feature, which is a proof of concept, so not ready for
production: the metadata ingestion scripts. It is a set of python script to generate a METS
manifest file for a collection, parse it and populate a neo4j graphDB.

B2SAFE package 3.2-beta [2016/08/24]
It includes two main new features:
1) the monitoring probe for iRODS: a bash script compatible with nagios-like tools to actively monitor the iRODS server

metadata handling.

- improved documentation
- added new rules: EUDATgetLastAVU, EUDATModifyAVU, EUDATcountMetaKeys
  EUDATrp_checkMeta, EUDATrp_ingestObject, EUDATrp_transferInitiated, EUDATrp_transferFinished
