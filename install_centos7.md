uploaded before the upgrades.
This entails following:
* Download the b2handle code from: https://github.com/EUDAT-B2SAFE/B2HANDLE
* Create an rpm and install it on the b2safe system. With the necessary

python setup.py bdist_rpm
````

```bash
yum install <created_rpm in dist directory> 
```

* Ask the handle hosting service which user to use for a certificate.
* Create a private/public keypair and create a derived certificate as described
